# Welcome to My Users App
***

## Task
Develop a user management application with CRUD operations on user data, including authentication and authorization for secure access. Optimize performance and scalability to handle a large user base.

## Description
My Users App is a web-based solution for managing user data, featuring CRUD operations and secure access controls. The front-end, built with React.js, offers a responsive interface, while the back-end, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles API requests and database interactions. Authentication is implemented using Passport.js, allowing for secure user registration and login. Role-based access control restricts admin-only actions. Performance enhancements include database indexing, caching, and optimized queries. Horizontal scaling is achieved through load balancing and cloud deployment on platforms like AWS or Azure.

## Installation
To run My Users App:

1. Configure environment variables in a .env file (e.g., database connection details).
2. Start the application with npm start.
3. Access the app via http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
After installation:

- Register a new user via the "Register" button.
- Log in using your credentials.
- Access user management features to view, add, edit, or delete users. Admins have exclusive permissions for - these actions.
